# Gerrymandering: Theory and Practice

## 0. Intro (5; 5)
  * name, agenda, introductions, etc.
  * what is redistricting

## 1. Drawing districts (5; 10)
  * hand out 1
  * draw 6 districts!
  * show some examples, vote on one, critique it
  * what's wrong with this (equipopulation)

## 2. Drawing districts, for reals (8; 18)
  * hand out 2
  * explain notation, draw 6 districts (5 blocks each)!
  * show some examples

## 3. Gerrymandering (11; 29)
  * this class isn't just about being nice
  * elbridge gerry (show intro slide again)
  * general idea of how + why
  * split class into red and blue
  * hand out 3
  * draw 6 districts (5 blocks each): want 5 districts that will be blue (60/40), 1 red (0/100)
  * show some examples
  * talk about how we did it

## 4. An interlude of Good (8; 37)
  * so now we've been evil, let's be good
  * you decide what that means
  * pick a partner from the opposite party
  * hand out 4 (same as 3)

## 5. Incumbency (4; 41)
  * talk about incumbency
  * hand out 5 (3 w/ incumbents)
  * draw 5 new districts (30 blocks each)
  * option between helping your incumbents and hurting theirs, or drawing
    everyone safe districts

## 6. Race (4; 45)
  * talk about race
  * hand out 6 (3 w/ race)
  * draw 5 new districts (30 blocks each)
  * want to have at least one majority-green district

## 7. This is real (5, 50)
  * hand out real maps
    * MA: here
    * MD: crazy D
    * NC: crazy R, but now thrown out (show old and new)
    * FL: challenged in court, you can go see all proposed maps
    * AZ: commission
    * TODO: maybe print some of steven wolf's maps or other hypotheticals
  * show differences in compactness metrics (from 6.S897)
  * various methods of districting
  * Voting Rights Act
  * possible concerns
    * partisan bias
    * race
    * incumbency
    * communities
    * compactness
    * appearance of reasonability
    * seats-votes curve

## 8. send out
  * what various relevant states do
  * recent news stories
  * compactness etc. resources
  * games/district builder
  * papers (e.g. Chen/Rodden)
  * MIT classes/OCW links (17.251, 17.263, 17.267, 6.S897)
  * blog post?
